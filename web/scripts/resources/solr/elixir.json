The principle of the quantification is described in Pesavento et al. (Analytical Chemistry, 2006). We recommend the use of the software for middle-down or top-down analyses, as it is suitable for direct comparison of single sequences with scrambled combinatorial PTMs. The user interface provides a choice for CID/HCD or ETD fragmentation.

The exact quantities for “mainly” and “most” are modeled with two easy-to-interpret parameters (K, L) that allows the user to control the number of outliers (not dysregulated genes/cases) in the solutions. We developed two slightly varying models (INES and GLONE) that fall into the class of NP-Hard optimization problems.

In addition, the peak component ensures the fast storage and retrieval of metabolic data. As opposed to the open source database TrialDB [LINK], a database model was designed, not only utilizing the EAV principal but also including simple classes and relations.
