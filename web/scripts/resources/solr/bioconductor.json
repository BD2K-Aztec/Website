As the method is conventionally used on entire omic datasets, such as transcriptomes, it may be dominated by pathways and processes that are substantially represented in a dataset, however the approach may overlook smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may be of great biological relevance. In order to detect these discrete molecular triggers, we developed a tool, co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis (cogena), for clustering differentially expressed genes and identification of highly correlated molecular expression clusters. Cogena offers the user a range of clustering methods, including hierarchical clustering, model based clustering and self-organised mapping, based on different distance metrics like correlation and mutual information. After obtaining and visualising clusters, cogena performs gene set enrichment. These gene sets can be sourced from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) or user-defined gene sets. By performing gene set enrichment across expression clusters, we find considerable enhancement in the resolution of molecular signatures in omic data at the cluster level compared to the whole.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/cogena_1.0.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 3.2)"," cluster"," ggplot2"," gplots"," amap"],"licenses":["LGPL-3"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Clustering","GeneSetEnrichment","GeneExpression","Visualization","Pathways","Microarray","Sequencing","SystemsBiology","DataRepresentation","DataImport"],"authors":["Zhilong Jia [aut","Michael Barnes [aut]"],"authorEmails":["",""],"maintainers":["Zhilong Jia "],"maintainerEmails":["<zhilongjia@gmail.com>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/coGPS.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/coGPS/inst/doc/coGPS.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"coGPS","versionNum":"1.12.0","description":"Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of P-value based statistics for outlier gene detection in dataset merged from multiple studies","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/coGPS_1.12.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.13.0)"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Microarray","DifferentialExpression"],"authors":["Yingying Wei","Michael Ochs"],"authorEmails":["",""],"maintainers":["Yingying Wei "],"maintainerEmails":["<ywei@jhsph.edu>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/COHCAP.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/COHCAP/inst/doc/COHCAP.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics","Epigenomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"COHCAP","versionNum":"1.6.0","description":"This package provides a pipeline to analyze single-nucleotide resolution methylation data (Illumina 450k methylation array, targeted BS-Seq, etc.).

The result is a more robust identification and quantification of low-intensity MS signals compared to conventional approaches where peak picking is performed in each LCMS/GCMS file separately.

Starting from normalized microarray or RNA-seq gene expression values (stored in lists of ExpressionSet and CountDataSet objects) the package performs differential expression analysis using the limma or DESeq packages. Supplying a simple list of gene identifiers, global differential expression profiles or data from complete experiments as input, users can use a unified set of several well-known gene set enrichment analysis methods to retrieve experiments with similar changes in gene expression. To take into account the directionality of gene expression changes, gCMAPQuery introduces the SignedGeneSet class, directly extending GeneSet from the GSEABase package.  To increase performance of large queries, multiple gene sets are stored as sparse incidence matrices within CMAPCollection eSets. gCMAP offers implementations of 1. Fisher's exact test (Fisher, J R Stat Soc, 1922) 2. The \"connectivity map\" method (Lamb et al, Science, 2006) 3. Parametric and non-parametric t-statistic summaries (Jiang & Gentleman, Bioinformatics, 2007) and 4. Wilcoxon / Mann-Whitney rank sum statistics (Wilcoxon, Biometrics Bulletin, 1945) as well as wrappers for the 5. camera (Wu & Smyth, Nucleic Acid Res, 2012) 6. mroast and romer (Wu et al, Bioinformatics, 2010) functions from the limma package and 7. wraps the gsea method from the mgsa package (Bauer et al, NAR, 2010). All methods return CMAPResult objects, an S4 class inheriting from AnnotatedDataFrame, containing enrichment statistics as well as annotation data and providing simple high-level summary plots.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/gCMAP_1.12.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["GSEABase"," limma (>= 3.20.0)"],"licenses":["Artistic-2.0"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Microarray","Software","Pathways","Annotation"],"authors":["Thomas Sandmann","Richard Bourgon","Sarah Kummerfeld"],"authorEmails":["<sandmann.thomas@gene.com>","<bourgon.richard@gene.com>","<kummerfeld.sarah@gene.com>"],"maintainers":["Thomas Sandmann "],"maintainerEmails":["<sandmann.thomas@gene.com>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/gCMAPWeb.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/gCMAPWeb/inst/doc/gCMAPWeb.pdf,","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/gCMAPWeb/inst/doc/referenceDatasets.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"gCMAPWeb","versionNum":"1.8.0","description":"The gCMAPWeb R package provides a graphical user interface for the gCMAP package. gCMAPWeb uses the Rook package and can be used either on a local machine, leveraging R's internal web server, or run on a dedicated rApache web server installation. gCMAPWeb allows users to search their own data sources and instructions to generate reference datasets from public repositories are included with the package. The package supports three common types of analyses, specifically queries with 1. one or two sets of query gene identifiers, whose members are expected to show changes in gene expression in a consistent direction. For example, an up-regulated gene set might contain genes activated by a transcription factor, a down-regulated geneset targets repressed by the same factor. 2. a single set of query gene identifiers, whose members are expected to show divergent differential expression (non-directional query). For example, members of a particular signaling pathway, some of which may be up- some down-regulated in response to a stimulus. 3. a query with the complete results of a differential expression profiling experiment. For example, gene identifiers and z-scores from a previous perturbation experiment. gCMAPWeb accepts three types of identifiers: EntreIds, gene Symbols and microarray probe ids and can be configured to work with any species supported by Bioconductor.

Variance homogeneity and uncorrelated residuals cannot be expected. Application of ordinary least squares gives unbiased, but no longer optimal estimates (Gauss-Markov-Aitken). Therefore, using the classical F-test is inappropriate, due to correlation. The test statistic however mirrors deviations from the null hypothesis. In combination with a permutation approach, empirical significance levels can be approximated. Alternatively, an approximation yields asymptotic p-values.

Testing is addressed through several test statistics: global likelihood ratio test (E2), Bartholomew 1961, Barlow et al. 1972 and Robertson et al. 1988), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus (1976), the M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007). The p-values of the global likelihood ratio test (E2) are obtained using the exact distribution and permutations. The other four test statistics are obtained using permutations. Several p-values adjustment are provided: Bonferroni, Holm (1979), Hochberg (1988), and Sidak procedures for controlling the family-wise Type I error rate (FWER), and BH (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2001) procedures are used for controlling the FDR. The inference is based on resampling methods, which control the False Discovery Rate (FDR), for both permutations (Ge et al., 2003) and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM, Tusher et al., 2001). Clustering methods are outsourced from CRAN packages ORCME, ORIClust. The package ORCME is based on delta-clustering method (Cheng and Church, 2000) and ORIClust on Order Restricted Information Criterion (Liu et al., 2009), both perform same task but from different perspective and their outputs are clusters of genes. Additionally, profile selection for given gene based on Generalized ORIC (Kuiper et al., 2014) from package goric and permutation test for E2 based on package orQA are included in IsoGene-GUI.

As core functionality, kebabs implements following sequence kernels: spectrum kernel, mismatch kernel, gappy pair kernel, and motif kernel. Apart from an efficient implementation of standard position-independent functionality, the kernels are extended in a novel way to take the position of patterns into account for the similarity measure. Because of the flexibility of the kernel formulation, other kernels like the weighted degree kernel or the shifted weighted degree kernel with constant weighting of positions are included as special cases. An annotation-specific variant of the kernels uses annotation information placed along the sequence together with the patterns in the sequence. The package allows for the generation of a kernel matrix or an explicit feature representation in dense or sparse format for all available kernels which can be used with methods implemented in other R packages. With focus on SVM-based methods, kebabs provides a framework which simplifies the usage of existing SVM implementations in kernlab, e1071, and LiblineaR. Binary and multi-class classification as well as regression tasks can be used in a unified way without having to deal with the different functions, parameters, and formats of the selected SVM. As support for choosing hyperparameters, the package provides cross validation - including grouped cross validation, grid search and model selection functions. For easier biological interpretation of the results, the package computes feature weights for all SVMs and prediction profiles which show the contribution of individual sequence positions to the prediction result and indicate the relevance of sequence sections for the learning result and the underlying biological functions.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/kebabs_1.2.3.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 3.2.0)"," Biostrings (>= 2.35.5)"," kernlab"],"licenses":["GPL (>= 2.1)"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["SupportVectorMachine","Classification","Clustering","Regression"],"authors":["Johannes Palme"],"authorEmails":[""],"maintainers":["Ulrich Bodenhofer "],"maintainerEmails":["<bodenhofer@bioinf.jku.at>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KEGGgraph.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/KEGGgraph/inst/doc/KEGGgraphApp.pdf,","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/KEGGgraph/inst/doc/KEGGgraph.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":[],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"KEGGgraph","versionNum":"1.26.0","description":"KEGGGraph is an interface between KEGG pathway and graph object as well as a collection of tools to analyze, dissect and visualize these graphs.

To minimize batch effects, a careful experiment design should ensure the even distribution of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment Tool) is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different batches. With minimum steps, it produces setup that optimizes the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, reducing the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest. It can also optimize the even distribution of confounding factors across batches. Our tool can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideal balanced RCBD.

In addition, rather than simply evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted. Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability.

NB: in the paper, we used ProMISe as both the model name and inferred score name.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/Roleswitch_1.6.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.10)"," pracma"," reshape"," plotrix"," microRNA"," biomaRt"," Biostrings"," Biobase"," DBI"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["miRNA"],"authors":["Yue Li"],"authorEmails":[""],"maintainers":["Yue Li "],"maintainerEmails":["<yueli@cs.toronto.edu>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rolexa.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Rolexa/inst/doc/Rolexa-vignette.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":[],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"Rolexa","versionNum":"1.24.0","description":"Provides probabilistic base calling, quality checks and diagnostic plots for Solexa sequencing data","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/Rolexa_1.24.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.9.0)"," graphics"," grDevices"," methods"," ShortRead"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Sequencing","DataImport","Preprocessing","QualityControl"],"authors":["Jacques Rougemont","Arnaud Amzallag","Christian Iseli","Laurent Farinelli","Ioannis Xenarios","Felix Naef"],"authorEmails":["","","","","",""],"maintainers":["Jacques Rougemont "],"maintainerEmails":["<jacques.rougemont@epfl.ch>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rols.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/rols/inst/doc/rols.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":[],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"rols","versionNum":"1.10.0","description":"This package allows to query EBI's Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP).","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/rols_1.10.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["methods"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Software","Annotation","MassSpectrometry","GO"],"authors":["Laurent Gatto"],"authorEmails":["<lg390@cam.ac.uk>"],"maintainers":["Laurent Gatto "],"maintainerEmails":["<lg390@cam.ac.uk>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ROntoTools.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ROntoTools/inst/doc/rontotools.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"ROntoTools","versionNum":"1.8.0","description":"Suite of tools for functional analysis","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/ROntoTools_1.8.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["methods"," graph"," boot"," KEGGREST"," KEGGgraph"," Rgraphviz"],"licenses":["GPL (>= 3)"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["NetworkAnalysis","Microarray","GraphsAndNetworks"],"authors":["Calin Voichita","Sorin Draghici"],"authorEmails":["<calin@wayne.edu>","<sorin@wayne.edu>"],"maintainers":["Calin Voichita "],"maintainerEmails":["<calin@wayne.edu>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","bug"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RPA.html","https://github.com/antagomir/RPA"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"RPA","versionNum":"1.24.0","description":"Probabilistic analysis of probe reliability and differential gene expression on short oligonucleotide arrays.

Next, the same procedure is applied to randomly generated gene sets, and P_random is calculated as the proportion achieving a P_pure as significant as the candidate gene set. Finally, a pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is performed by ranking all genes by concordance index, and P_enrich is computed to indicate the degree to which the candidate gene set is enriched for genes with univariate prognostic significance.

The output of seq2pathway is a general structure of quantitative pathway-level scores, thus allowing one to functional interpret such datasets as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, GWAS, and derived from other next generational sequencing experiments.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/seq2pathway_1.0.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.10.0)"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Software"],"authors":["Xinan Yang","Bin Wang"],"authorEmails":["<xyang2@uchicago.edu>","<binw@uchicago.edu>"],"maintainers":["Bin Wang "],"maintainerEmails":["<binw@uchicago.edu>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","bug","documentation","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SeqArray.html","http://github.com/zhengxwen/SeqArray/issues","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SeqArray/inst/doc/SeqArray-JSM2013.pdf,","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SeqArray/inst/doc/SeqArrayTutorial.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"SeqArray","versionNum":"1.8.0","description":"Big data management of genome-wide variants using the CoreArray C++ library: genotypic data and annotations are stored in an array-oriented manner, offering efficient access of genetic variants using the R programming language.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/SeqArray_1.8.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["gdsfmt (>= 1.2.2)"],"licenses":["GPL-3"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Infrastructure","Sequencing","Genetics"],"authors":["Xiuwen Zheng [aut","Stephanie Gogarten [aut]","Cathy Laurie [ctb]"],"authorEmails":["","",""],"maintainers":["Xiuwen Zheng "],"maintainerEmails":["<zhengx@u.washington.edu>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/seqbias.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/seqbias/inst/doc/overview.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":[],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"seqbias","versionNum":"1.16.0","description":"This package implements a model of per-position sequencing bias in high-throughput sequencing data using a simple Bayesian network, the structure and parameters of which are trained on a set of aligned reads and a reference genome sequence.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/seqbias_1.16.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.13.0)"," GenomicRanges (>= 0.1.0)"," Biostrings (>= 2.15.0)"," methods"],"licenses":["LGPL-3"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Sequencing"],"authors":["Daniel Jones"],"authorEmails":["<dcjones@cs.washington.edu>"],"maintainers":["Daniel Jones "],"maintainerEmails":["<dcjones@cs.washington.edu>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/seqCNA.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/seqCNA/inst/doc/seqCNA.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"seqCNA","versionNum":"1.14.0","description":"Copy number analysis of high-throughput sequencing cancer data with fast summarization, extensive filtering and improved normalization","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/seqCNA_1.14.0.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 3.0)"," GLAD (>= 2.14)"," doSNOW (>= 1.0.5)"," adehabitatLT (>= 0.3.4)"," seqCNA.annot (>= 0.99)"," methodssamtools"],"licenses":["GPL-3"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["CopyNumberVariation","Genetics","Sequencing"],"authors":["David Mosen-Ansorena"],"authorEmails":[""],"maintainers":["David Mosen-Ansorena "],"maintainerEmails":["<dmosen.gn@cicbiogune.es>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SeqGSEA.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/SeqGSEA/inst/doc/SeqGSEA.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"SeqGSEA","versionNum":"1.8.0","description":"The package generally provides methods for gene set enrichment analysis of high-throughput RNA-Seq data by integrating differential expression and splicing.

The data are visualized as average signal profile plot, with error estimates (standard error and 95% confidence interval) shown as fields, or as series of heatmaps that can be sorted and clustered using hierarchical clustering, k-means algorithm and self organising maps. Plots can be prepared using R programming language or web browser based graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Shiny framework. The dual-purpose implementation allows running the software locally on desktop or deploying it on server. SeqPlots is useful for both for exploratory data analyses and preparing replicable, publication quality plots. Other features of the software include collaboration and data sharing capabilities, as well as ability to store pre-calculated result matrixes, that combine many sequencing experiments and in-silico generated tracks with multiple different features. These binaries can be further used to generate new combination plots on fly, run automated batch operations or share with colleagues, who can adjust their plotting parameters without loading actual tracks and recalculating numeric values.

This can be done by performing a multi-step normalization strategy (called DEGES for DEG elimination strategy). A major characteristic of TCC is to provide the robust normalization methods for several kinds of count data (two-group with or without replicates, multi-group/multi-factor, and so on) by virtue of the use of combinations of functions in depended packages.","sourceCodeURL":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/TCC_1.8.2.tar.gz","dependencies":["R (>= 2.15)"," methods"," DESeq"," DESeq2"," edgeR"," baySeq"," ROC"],"licenses":["GPL-2"],"licenseUrls":[""],"tags":["Sequencing","DifferentialExpression","RNASeq"],"authors":["Jianqiang Sun","Tomoaki Nishiyama","Kentaro Shimizu","Koji Kadota"],"authorEmails":["","","",""],"maintainers":["Jianqiang Sun ","Tomoaki Nishiyama "],"maintainerEmails":["<wukong@bi.a.u-tokyo.ac.jp>","<tomoakin@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp>"]},{"linkDescriptions":["homepage","documentation"],"linkUrls":["http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TDARACNE.html","http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/TDARACNE/inst/doc/TDARACNE.pdf"],"platforms":["Linux (Unix)","Windows 32","Windows 64","Mac OS X 10.6","Mac OS X 10.9"],"domains":["Genomics"],"types":["Tool"],"language":"R","logo":"http://bioconductor.org/images/logo_bioconductor.gif","source":"BioConductor","name":"TDARACNE","versionNum":"1.18.0","description":"To infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge into bioinformatics research area.

These graphical models help understand the causal structure involving events promoting cancer progression, possibly predicting complex patterns characterising genomic progression of a cancer. Reconstructed models can be used to better characterise genotype-phenotype relation, and suggest novel targets for therapy design. TRONCO (TRanslational ONCOlogy) is a R package aimed at collecting state-of-the-art algorithms to infer progression models from cross-sectional data, i.e., data collected from independent patients which does not necessarily incorporate any evident temporal information. These algorithms require a binary input matrix where: (i) each row represents a patient genome, (ii) each column an event relevant to the progression (a priori selected) and a 0/1 value models the absence/presence of a certain mutation in a certain patient. The current first version of TRONCO implements the CAPRESE algorithm (Cancer PRogression Extraction with Single Edges) to infer possible progression models arranged as trees; cfr.
